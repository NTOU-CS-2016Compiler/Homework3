----------


1. #####Consider the context-free grammar:  
  `S -> S S + | S S * | a` and the string `aa + a*`.  
	1. Give a leftmost derivation for the string.
	2. Give a rightmost derivation for the string.
	3. Give a parse tree for the string.

2. #####Construct unambiguous context-free grammars for each of the following languages.
	1. Arithmetic expressions of integers and identifiers
	with the four binary operators `+, -, *, /`.
	2. Add unary plus and minus to the arithmetic operators of *the previous question*.

3. #####Is it possible, by modifying the grammar in any way, to construct a predictive parser for the language of Question 1 (*postfix expressions with operand a*)?

4. #####Compute FIRST and FOLLEW for the grammar of Question 1.

5. #####For the SDD shown below, give annotated parse trees for the following expressions:
	1. `(3+4)*(5+6) n.`
	2. `1*2*3*(4+5) n.`
